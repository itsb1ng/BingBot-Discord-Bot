# Accessibility to Slash Commands and Economy System

- Bot is hosted via Replit because I am broke and Economy system is loaded to json file
- bb!startmining to start the journey
- bb!help for all available commands

# Hypixel API 

- Uses Hypixel's API, Senither API, and SlothPixel API
- Mostly uses senither because all other APIs are inferior 
- bb!help hypixel or bb!help skyblock
